# md5 hashing tool

A recreation of the md5 hashing algorithm

Handles the following flags:

      -s      Print a checksum of the given string.
      
      -p      Echo stdin to stdout and append the checksum to stdout.
      
      -q      Quiet mode - only the checksum is printed out.  Overrides the -r option.
      
      -r      Reverses the format of the output.
      
Usage:
./a.out md5 [flag] [string object]
